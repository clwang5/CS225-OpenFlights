The output and correctness of each algorithm – You should summarize, visualize, or highlight some part of the full-scale run of each algorithm. Additionally, the report should briefly describe what tests you performed to confirm that each algorithm was working as intended.

##Output & Correctness

To test that each algorithm was working as intended, 
Dijkstra's test case included examples on the CS225 resources page.

The answer to your leading question – You should direct address your proposed leading question. How did you answer this question? What did you discover? If your project was ultimately unsuccessful, give a brief reflection about what worked and what you would do differently as a team.

When given two airports, our team planned on finding the shortest route from one airport to another. We answered this by using Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm and printing the path of the shortest route. We discovered that a big airport like O'Hare International airport is more likely to have a shorter path to other airports in comparison to a small airport to another small airport.

We are planning to use a Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm in order to find a preferred route using distance as the edge weight. We are also proposing to use Tarjan's algorithm to find strongly connected components. Using these two algorithms, we hope to gain insight into which airports are the most strongly connected to other airports, and if that correlates with popularity of these airports. We also hope to produce a general search tool for finding the shortest path between 2 airports, which could aid in planning vacations.
