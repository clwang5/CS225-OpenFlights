# Development Log (Date: XX/YY/ZZ -- XX/YY/ZZ)

## Weekly Goals
This week's goal was to use the preprocessed data and put it into a graph representation (adjacency list), and this was accomplished. 
## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
Jason and Raki handled this. 
## Problems Encountered 
No problems.
## Plans for next week
Next week is holiday, so nothing solid planned. Future plans are just to work on completing the 2 algorithms.
## Optional: Questions for mentor
We changed the vertex values to start from 0 and be contiguous to make creating an adjacency list easier. Would it be fine to use two unordered maps to map node value to airport name, and airport name to node value, or would there be a better implementation?
